# Rxjs beyond the basics - operators in depth

(egghead.io)

## 1. understanding operators

Create own operator `multiplyBy`

## 2. Use Marble diagram to understand

Represent operators ow they work.

## 3. Use RxJS mapTo and map to Transform Values 

showing map action in practice

## 4. Inspect the Behavior using do operator

Integrate `do` operator to show the debug flow

## 5. use filter operator

## 6. Filter Events with RxJS Operators take, first, and skip

## 7. Filter takeLast and last

## 8. Prepend/Append Data with RxJS Operators concat and startWith

## 9. Merge Values in Parallel with RxJS Operator merge

## 10. Join Values from Multiple Observables with combineLatest

## 11. Control the Output with withLatestFrom

## 12. Combine with zip

## 13. combine with scan

## 14. Group Consecutive Values Together with buffer

## 15. Delay the Emission of Values

## 16. Drop and Delay with debounce

`debounce` and `debounceTime` operators helps to reach the goal

## 17. Limit the Rate with throttle

`throttle` emits immediately and drops values between (like `debounce`)

## 18. Filter with distinct

## 19. handle Errors with catch

Replace wrong performing by another observable.
Handling not only one error, but also retrieve the observable

## 20. Resubscribe to an Observable on Error with retry

## 21. repeat
